            <h1>List of projects</h1>
            In general I have a lot of different smaller projects going on, but here I'll try to focus, on the "bigger" ones in scope. <br>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/ViliusIvanovas/Bad-Apple-CSharp">Bad Apple C#</a></h2>
            One of the bigger projects I've been putting time in recently, is my rendition of the music video for Bad Apple in a C# console. 
            While I could have quite easily imported a library that can play MP4 videos and be done, I decided that like many other C# renditions, it should run with ascii art. 
            But since I couldn't easily convert the MP4 to images to ascii, I decided to lend the code from another person (Linked in README). 
            The project is a good way of learning many functions and threading, now it's moving on to be a good way to learn music theory and how to use libraries like NAudio. 
            Hopefully I'll be able to finish it someday.
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/ViliusIvanovas/viliusivanovas.github.io">ViliusIvanovas.github.io</a></h2>
            This project is slowly helping me relearn good user design (Still far away from that), and coding in HTML and CSS.
            It has been nice to relearn some of the things I had learned with website making from the past.
            For now it's just going to be a page for about me and a bit of projects descriptions, but later on, I might move my gameplay ideas over here too.
            The big hope for the site, would be that one day I could import one of my C# projects to run on the site with a library.
